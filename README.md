# sales_analysis

A small project for analyzing retail sales data using the `SuperMarket Analysis.csv` dataset.

## Repository contents
- [main.py](main.py) — main analysis script that reads the dataset and generates outputs.  
- [SuperMarket_Analysis.csv](data/SuperMarket_Analysis.csv) — source dataset.  
- [outputs/](outputs/) — generated charts and reports.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- Recommended packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
Ensure the dataset `[SuperMarket Analysis.csv](SuperMarket%20Analysis.csv)` is in the repository root, then run:
```sh
python main.py
```
Generated artifacts will be written to the `[outputs/](outputs/)` directory.

## Output
Charts and summary reports produced by `[main.py](main.py)` are saved to `[outputs/](outputs/)`. Edit `[main.py](main.py)` to change analysis logic or output formats.
